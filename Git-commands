#make a new branch and checkout to that branch:

#for a new local branch(ashraf/slice), if no remote branch exists, but you want to create a new remote branch(say ashraf/slice)
# and track:
#(in local ashraf/branch)

#Rebasing the local branch(say RB) onto master
#Meaning: all the new changes from master now applying to the local RB, so that local RB is now uptodated
1. Make sure local master is updated
 git checkout master
 git pull origin master
2. Then checkout your branch and rebase your changes on master :
 git checkout RB
 git rebase master # now RB got all updates  from updated master
3. push your updated local RB to the remote RB
 git push

#see differences between  branch1 and master
 git diff master...branch1 #see how branch2 is diverged from master

# creating patch between two branches (master and branch1):
git diff $(git merge-base master branch1) > patch1

#check if applying patch will be with no error, by actually not applying
git apply --check padfusion1

#apply the patch
#copy the patch in the repo and have the correct branch checked
git apply patch1
